{"name":"Crabfolk","type":"ancestry","img":"icons/creatures/fish/crab-blue-purple.webp","system":{"description":{"value":"<h2>You might&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>have a strong sense for family, friends, and community.</li>\n<li>enjoy dancing or partying at any opportunity possible.</li>\n<li>try to use the remains of other crabfolk for tools or armor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Think you engage in necromancy or cannibalistic rituals due to your tradition of harnessing the remains of fallen kin.</li>\n<li>appreciate your ingenuity and resourcefulness.</li>\n<li>want to dance along with you!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Crabfolk tend to grow to about the same size as humans, usually in the same amount of time as well. They possess a humanoid body shape, having two arms and standing on two legs. Though crabfolk might look slim at a glance, their thick exoskeletons are quite dense, and even some of the strongest of weightlifters have trouble picking up a crabfolk. Some crabfolk have exceptionally thick exoskeletons that can mimic even the toughest of armors, and these can weigh well over 200 pounds. In terms of coloration, crabfolk tend to adopt colors that match the environment near them. Those who live near the ocean will have lighter shades of blue or green, while those who reside near swamps or marshes might take on a darker hue. Desert crabfolk, though an uncommon sight to begin with, are usually going to be somewhere in the range of tan to orange.</p>\n<p>Crabfolk tend to molt once per year up until they fully mature, shedding their skin for another layer that can better accomodate their growing bodies. Their hands, if you can call them that, have two pinchers, used to pick up materials and eat with. Many crabfolk can use these to fight with, though not all were built for combat. Because of their lack of opposable digits, many of the tools that they use are cylindrical or flat - too many moving parts would make even mundane tasks troublesome.</p>\n<p>Crabfolk mature at around 15 years of age, and their usual lifespan takes them to around 40.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Crabfolk, though not technically aquatic creatures, generally tend to place their civilizations near large bodies of water. Few have adapted to desert terrains, and the ones that do often find themselves near an oasis in order to have a constant source of water. Even fewer have adapted to urban areas, though one can normally spot a crabfolk or two if said city borders a sea or ocean.</p>\n<p>One of the unique aspects of crabfolk culture is their respect for the dead. Large, extravagent wakes are thrown for those whose souls have moved on to the Boneyard, and the crabfolk come together in song and dance in order to celebrate the life of the one who passed. Though the flesh of the fallen will decay into nothingness, the exteriors are kept clean and are often repurposed. Tools, building materials, and even shields have been made out of their shells, as they can remain sturdy for years. There are some that wish to return to nature after they pass, and crabfolk tradition dictates that their shell be ground into fertilizer to help nature prosper.</p>\n<p>Crabfolk share many similar traditions with dwarves, and as such, are quick to form bonds with them. There is a mutual appreciation of the sharing of tradition and a strong sense of community, as well as their desire to create. Some crabfolk have introduced dwarves to chitin as a form of armor or shielding, though many of these dwarves are apprehensive of this technique due to how said material is acquired.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Crabfolk have a very strong sense of community, family, and respect, and as a result, tend to be lawful good. That being said, there are plenty of crabfolk with a sense of wanderlust, freedom, and adventure, and these crabfolk often lean towards chaotic alignments. In particular, hermit crabfolk, with only the shell on their backs to call home, generally fall into this category.</p>\n<p>Though hunting is usually an afterthought to most crabfolk, many follow in the steps of Erastil's teachings, as his teachings in community and family strike home with many crabfolk. Those that are more in tune with nature often follow Gozreh, while others - usually more adventurous crabfolk - might worship Besmara if they are constantly at sea.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Crabfolk usually form their names out of chitters and clicks, with an occasional hiss thrown in for good measure.</p>\n<h3>Sample Names</h3>\n<p>Ix, Ch'dir, Akkak, Kt'iss</p>\n<h1>Crabfolk Mechanics</h1>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Constitution, Wisdom, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Flaw(s)</strong> Dexterity</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Brachien</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your intelligence modifier.
